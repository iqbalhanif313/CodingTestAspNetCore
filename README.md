Dear Hiring Manager

Im sorry for being late to submit the test due to some trouble happening to my computer hardware.
it's need couple days to repair it due to the delivery of the hardware which is needed to be replaced.

This Coding Test Project is developed using Visual Studio 2019 and SQL Server:

Please notice the intruction before running the project:

/// Im sorry for not providing this project in docker
/// because docker-desktop requires windows 10 OS while im still using windows 8.1 OS 
/// and it's a bit complecated to integrated docker-toolbox with visual studio 2019
/// 
/// before run the project, please ensure that the database is migrated.
/// to use migration, use syntax at Package Manager Console:
/// 
/// From the Tools menu, select NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console (PMC):
/// In the PMC, enter the following commands:
/// 
/// PM> Update-Database
///
